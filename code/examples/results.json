A chipper young woman, maybe half his age, says cheerfully to the cashier, \\\"Don't you just love seeing what people are buying?\\\" The cashier looks blankly at the young woman and smiles. The middle aged man does the same. The young lady looks at the man and says, \\\"I don't know what those crackers are, but they look really good.\\\"\\n\\nWell, they aren't crackers, they are Pim's chocolate covered orange European biscuits. Basically, cookies. And they go really nicely with a glass of milk. There's a parallel universe in which I responded to your observation with a quick, \\\"They're cookies.

For some reason I thought I would hear from you right at our time but I was also dreading it.  I couldn't reply to your last text in June after you cruelly ignored my last email expressing my love and how wonderful I thought you were. I was wrong about you all along. Too bad it took so many years to figure it out. I just felt rather than reply, it would be easier to just fade away. If you really wanted me you'd try harder. Baskin Robbins sent me a text on my birthday too but at least I got a free cone. You phoned us in. You were reckless with my heart. You killed us with neglect. I called your bluff and gave you my heart and you just threw it away like trash, until you were bored and needed a diversion. I supported every side of you, kept your secrets and was willing to accept crumbs. Shame on me for not seeing you were ever going to choose to lead an authentic life. Despite that, I am working on forgiveness and wish happiness for you as you find yourself and learn to love yourself, because that's really the issue here. You treated me horribly because deep down you hate yourself. And I hate myself for taking you back over and over. I don't think you even understand  how bad your behavior was. i.e. You literally left me on 42nd St. at midnight and didn't even think to check if I was ok. I felt so cheap. I hugged you longer and insisted on giving you that token because I knew that was the last time I'd ever see you. You never gave me anything in all our years. Never. I was appalled by your treatment of me and I deserve so much more. You know this. You are a self professed narcissistic selfish person. Why didn't I believe you? Why did I keep seeing  your innocence? Why couldn't I stop loving you? Most romantic memories of my life. But we weren't meant to meet on that star afterall.  All those songs will never be played again. She can have you now since you two are the true soulmates.
